# Verification Guide

This document provides steps to verify that all the professional configurations are working correctly.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a package manager installed:
- npm, or
- yarn, or
- pnpm

## Verification Steps

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

### 2. Verify ESLint

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
# or
pnpm lint
```

You should see linting results for your codebase. If there are no errors, you'll see something like:
```
âœ“ No ESLint warnings or errors
```

### 3. Verify Prettier

```bash
npm run format
# or
yarn format
# or
pnpm format
```

This will format your code according to your Prettier configuration.

### 4. Verify TypeScript type checking

```bash
npm run type-check
# or
yarn type-check
# or
pnpm type-check
```

If there are no type errors, the command will complete with no output.

### 5. Verify Jest tests

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

This will run your test suite. Since we don't have tests yet, it might show:
```
No tests found
```

### 6. Verify pre-commit hook

Make a change to any file, then try to commit it:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify pre-commit hook"
```

The pre-commit hook should run lint-staged, which will lint and format your staged files before allowing the commit.

## What's Next?

Once you've verified that all tools are working correctly, you can:

1. Start moving your components to their appropriate directories
2. Write tests for your components
3. Set up your CI/CD pipeline with the provided GitHub Actions workflows

## Commit Message for the Professional Setup

Once everything is verified, you can use this commit message:

```
